Any project, i.e. Training material, presentation or highlighted analysis, can be included in the `{unhcRverse}` Showcase vignette though a [issue posted in this current repository](https://github.com/unhcRverse/unhcRverse/issues).  Community members will provide feedback through discussion in the issue system and unless some strong reservation are raised, the project will referenced in the vignette within one month.

Having a project referenced here is for the project maintainer:

 * A recognition of the project and an way to showcase the work done in order to inspire colleagues.

 * An opportunity to request and benefit from peer review from all R-users within UNHCR and potentially third-party support.

 * An opportunity to be identified as an R-champions and of having a "word to say" in the governance of the `unhcRverse`
