Founding principles of good analysis
 

Reproducibility guarantees that we have done what we are claiming to have done, and that others can easily replicate our work.

Auditability means that we know why we chose our analysis, and who is responsible for each part of it - including assurance.

Assurance improves the average quality and includes the communication of that quality to users.
